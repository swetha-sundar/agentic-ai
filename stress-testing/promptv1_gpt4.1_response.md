**System Prompt:** Think like a Risk Manager in a large bank who is creating stress test scenarios for macroeconomic downturn scenarios, market risk scenarios and credit risk scenarios. Break down the problem and tell me how a risk manager should think about creating a scenario that demonstrates the impact of a given event

**User Prompt:** US China Geopolitical event

Certainly. Let’s break down how a scenario designer (think Risk Management or Scenario Analysis function) should think about structuring a stress scenario for US-China geopolitical tensions. The goal is to translate this hazy, qualitative event into a set of quantifiable shocks and rational pathways so that the rest of the risk modeling process (credit, market, operational, liquidity, etc.) can translate it into numbers.


1. Define a Specific Stress Event

Don’t stay vague—be explicit about what the “US-China geopolitical tension” means:

An imposition of broad tariffs across most goods/services.
Escalation leading to partial or full trade embargo on technology or critical goods.
Financial sanctions, e.g., restrictions on Chinese institutions in the global dollar system.
Military saber-rattling causing global risk-off.

Pick one, combine a few, or explore a range (mild, moderate, severe).


2. Identify Macro-Level Channels of Transmission

Think about how the event moves through the global financial and economic system. For each pathway, what is the mechanism?

Trade channel (export/import disruptions, supply chain slowing).
Financial markets (equity sell-off, USD appreciation, RMB depreciation, liquidity tightening).
FX and interest rates
Commodity prices (e.g., oil, rare earths).
Business and consumer confidence (investment delays, reduced consumption).
Operational risks (sanctions, cross-border payments interruption).


3. Map to Risk Categories

How do the macro-level events create risk for the bank?

Credit Risk:
Deterioration of obligor creditworthiness (exporters/importers, sectors reliant on China-US trade, emerging markets, etc.).
Downgrades, higher probability of default (PD).
Higher LGDs if collateral values (e.g., equities, real estate) fall.
Market Risk:
Equities: US, Chinese, and global stocks decline, especially sectors exposed to global trade, semiconductors, autos, luxury, etc.
Fixed income: Spread widening for IG/HY credit, UST/Bund rally as safe havens.
FX: RMB depreciation, EMFX contagion; USD and JPY as safe havens.
Commodities: Iron ore, rare earths, oil—direction depends on event details.
Liquidity Risk:
Funding markets react; short-term USD funding may dry up, high FX swap basis.
Stressed market depth for at-risk asset classes.
Operational, Legal & Compliance Risks:
Cross-border transaction blocks, asset freezes, sanctions violation risk.
Increased compliance costs.


4. Quantify the Scenario: Assign Numeric Shocks

Leverage history (e.g., 2018-2019 trade dispute, Russia-Ukraine sanctions) and model overlays. Define scenario variables:

GDP growth: -X% for US, -Y% for China, global spillover.
Equity markets: S&P 500 -20%, Hang Seng -30%, EM equities -25%.
Credit spreads: IG +100bps, HY +300bps.
FX: RMB -15% vs USD, EUR -3%, EMFX -10%.
Commodity prices: oil +10% (if supply fears), or -10% (if demand collapse).
Policy response: Lower rates, possible QE, swap lines open? Or not.

Specify horizon (immediate, 3m, 6m, 1yr), magnitude (mild, severe), and cross-sensitivities.


5. Translate Macro Shocks Down to Portfolio/Business Impact


Corporate lending: impact on specific borrowers/sectors with China exposures.
Trade finance: drop in volumes, increased defaults.
Securities lending, margin calls.
Mark-to-market on trading books.
Funding costs and ability to monetize collateral.


6. Feedback and Reverse Stress


Explore tail events: “What if RMB devaluation is disorderly?” “What if sanctions freeze a major Chinese bank’s USD assets?”
Map interactions: Are some portfolios exposed to multiple vectors? (e.g., Asian supply chains + EM lending)


7. Document Assumptions and Uncertainties


What are the critical drivers?
Where is there most uncertainty? (Policy response, market depth)
What risk mitigants exist?


Example Scenario: "Severe US-China Tension"


Event: US imposes 25% tariffs on all Chinese imports; China responds with reciprocal measures and partial USD asset freezes. US restricts Chinese bank access to USD clearing.
Macro Shocks:
US GDP -1.5%, China GDP -3% 1yr forward.
S&P -20%, Hang Seng -30%, IG spreads +120bps, HY +400bps.
CNY/USD to 8.0 (+15% depreciation), EMFX -10%.
Oil +15% on logistics fears; global trade volumes -10%.
Portfolio Impact:
US and Asian exporters downgraded. Defaults spike in global trade finance.
Outflows from EM assets drive sizable MTM losses; margin calls stress hedge fund clients.


Summary Table


Step	Action Example
Specify event	"Full US-China trade embargo"
Map transmission channels	Trade collapse, financial panic
Assign macro shocks	S&P -20%, CNY -15%, IG +100bps
Portfolio linkages	Asian exporters, EM credit, FX
Explore mitigation	Hedging, central bank intervention
Feedback/test extremes	Coordinated sanctions, frozen assets

A scenario designer should always anchor even “soft” geopolitical events to actual, testable, numerically tractable assumptions, and build from the event to the financial impact step by step, with sector and portfolio mapping.
