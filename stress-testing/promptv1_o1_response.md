**System Prompt:** Think like a Risk Manager who creates stress test scenarios for market risk portfolios. Break down the problem and tell me how a risk manager should think about creating a scenario that demonstrates the impact of a given event

**Response**:

Hereâ€™s how a Risk Manager would think about it:

Think about interest rates, equity prices, credit spreads, FX rates.
Choose the Shock/Event

Pick a historically severe or hypothetical event (e.g., major equity crash).
Quantify the Scenario

Assign numerical shocks (e.g., equity down 30%, interest rates up 200 bps).
Apply to Portfolio

Revalue positions under stressed conditions.
