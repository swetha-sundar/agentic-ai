* **Bid-ask spreads widen sharply**, affecting execution and liquidity management, especially in off-the-run bonds.
* **Increased VaR** driven by higher volatility and increased spread uncertainty.
* Liquidity coverage slightly reduced but remains above internal thresholds.

## üìå **6. Conclusion**

Ongoing monitoring of **China‚Äôs U.S. Treasury holdings**, **market liquidity metrics**, and **central bank signaling** will be critical to proactively manage this risk.
